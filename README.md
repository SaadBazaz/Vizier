# Vizier
ðŸ“¶ Manage your IoT devices with a few clicks

Vizier helps you manage your microcontrollers in one clean and simple UI. You can add devices, create custom mappings to each pin, and manage authentication and logs, all from one place.

### How to use
To run the client (from root) 
```cd vizier```
```npm run serve```

The client must have the server running in the background in order to work properly.
For that (from root)
```cd vizier-server```
```node app.js```

### Note
This app is under construction and I wish to keep it open-source. If you have any suggestions, feel free to drop a comment, Issue or Pull Request! Happy coding :)
